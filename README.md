# EE211_Digital Image processing

##This includes the homeworks and final project of Course Digital Image Processing in 2018



## Homework1 : Implemented Image Convolution functions with Sobel filter and Gaussian filter for edge detection and image blurring


## Homework2: Implemented two basic operators in mathematical morphology : erotion and dilation. Applied these two operators in images and applied thresholding for image segmentation and extract the text in the non-uniform lighting images.

## Final project: Implemented K-Means algorithm for medical image segmentation, applied DRLSE algorithm and identified different tissue in fluorescence medical images.
